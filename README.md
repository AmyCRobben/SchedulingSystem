# SchedulingSystem
Files used in my Software Engineering project, Spring 2016
In this project, we worked with Georgia College's Learning Center to help design and create a scheduling system
for the tutor employees that worked there.

The files in this repository are some of the files I worked on that use PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
